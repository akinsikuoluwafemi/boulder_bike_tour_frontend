These communities are meant to educate and provide a forum for discussion and knowledge sharing around topics that are top-of-mind for developers in a particular market.</li>
                        <li>In Sub-Saharan Africa alone, there are over 40K active developers in 45 cities across 17 countries using Developer Circles. Developer Circles is committed to empowering these developers to build real-life, locally relevant solutions focused on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) while gaining the skills they need to advance their careers.</li>

                        <li>Facebook is a company that grew from the developer community, and Developer Circles is a program aimed at making local developers stronger at a global scale. The Developer Community has always been one of Facebook’s most important partners.</li>
                        <li>Through programs like Developer Circles, we give back to this community by helping them collaborate, learn, and code with other local developers. Today, we’re continuing that support through our newest developer program—Developer Circles & Andela: #BuildforSDG Challenge.</li>
